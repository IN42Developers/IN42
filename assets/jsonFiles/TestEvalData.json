  student or group.

- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that 
  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an 
  empty folder.

- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you and make you 
  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.

- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used 
  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).

- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have 
  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.

- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning 
  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. 
  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, 
  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are 
  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order 
  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.

- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it 
  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons 
  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.

- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on 
  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. 
  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, 
  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the 
  appropriate flag.

- Remain polite, courteous, respectful and constructive throughout the 
  evaluation process. The well-being of the community depends on it.

- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible 
  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the 
  problems that may have been identified.

- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers 
  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its 
  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as 
  possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is 
  done seriously.
