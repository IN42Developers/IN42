   student or group.\
 \
 - Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \
   the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \
   empty folder.\
 \
 - Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you and make you \
   evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\
 \
 - To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \
   to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\
 \
 - If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \
   to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\
 \
 - Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \
   program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \
   In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \
   or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \
   strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \
   to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\
 \
 - You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \
   exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \
   with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\
 \
 - You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \
   the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \
   You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \
   such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \
   appropriate flag.",

 \
 - Remain polite, courteous, respectful and constructive throughout the \
   evaluation process. The well-being of the community depends on it.\
 \
 - Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \
   dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \
   problems that may have been identified.\
 \
 - You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \
   might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \
   functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \
   possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is \
   done seriously.\
